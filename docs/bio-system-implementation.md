  2. **Personal** (Level 2): Private preferences, personality traits - ‚úÖ Store
  3. **Sensitive** (Level 3): Financial situations, family conflicts - ‚ùå Filter Out
  4. **Confidential** (Level 4): Medical info, precise locations - ‚ùå Filter Out

## Implementation Phases

### ‚úÖ Phase 1: Foundation (COMPLETED)
**Goal**: Establish data models and privacy framework

**Implemented Components**:
- Privacy classification system with 4-tier levels
- BiographicalInsight and UserBio data models
- BioStorageService with full CRUD operations
- PrivacyFilterService with AI-powered filtering
- Database schema extensions in DatabaseService
- Comprehensive privacy protection framework

**Key Features**:
- Privacy-first architecture design
- AI-powered privacy classification
- Regex fallback for offline privacy analysis
- Configurable privacy thresholds
- User consent and control mechanisms

### ‚úÖ Phase 2: Real-time Bio Analysis (COMPLETED)
**Goal**: Implement live insight extraction during prophet interactions

**Implemented Components**:
- BioAnalysisAgent service with full AI integration
- VisionIntegrationService enhancement with bio analysis hooks
- Dual analysis capability (questions + responses)
- Non-blocking background processing
- Integration at two key interaction points

**Integration Points**:
1. **Question-Answer Flow**: `generateAndStoreQuestionVision()`
   - User asks question ‚Üí Prophet responds ‚Üí Bio analysis extracts insights
2. **Random Vision Flow**: `generateAndStoreRandomVision()`
   - Random vision generated ‚Üí Bio analysis extracts user engagement patterns

**Technical Implementation**:
```dart
// Integration in VisionIntegrationService
_bioAgent.analyzeInteraction(
  context: context,
  profet: profet,
  response: visionText,
  question: question,
  userId: userId,
).catchError((error) {
  AppLogger.logWarning(_component, 'Bio analysis failed: $error');
});
```

**Key Features**:
- Automatic insight extraction after every prophet interaction
- Privacy filtering before storage
- Non-disruptive background operation
- Comprehensive error handling
- Detailed logging for monitoring

### ‚úÖ Phase 3: Context Integration (COMPLETED)
**Goal**: Use collected insights to personalize prophet responses

**Implemented Components**:
- BioContextService: Generates personalized context from biographical insights
- Enhanced Profet methods: getAIPersonalizedResponseWithContext and getAIRandomVisionWithContext
- VisionIntegrationService enhancement: Integration with BioContextService
- Relevance scoring and insight selection algorithms
- Engagement pattern analysis for response style adaptation

**Integration Points**:
1. **Question-Answer Personalization**: `generateAndStoreQuestionVision()`
   - Generates personalized context based on user question and history
   - Enhances system prompt with relevant biographical insights
   - Uses relevance scoring to select most appropriate insights
2. **Random Vision Personalization**: `generateAndStoreRandomVision()`
   - Uses user interests summary for context-aware random visions
   - Tailors spiritual guidance based on user's background and preferences

**Technical Implementation**:
```dart
// Enhanced system prompt generation
String enhancedSystemPrompt = baseSystemPrompt;
if (personalizedContext != null && personalizedContext.isNotEmpty) {
  enhancedSystemPrompt += '\n\n$personalizedContext';
}

// AI response with personalization
final response = await AIServiceManager.generateResponse(
  prompt: question,
  systemMessage: enhancedSystemPrompt,
  maxTokens: 200,
  temperature: 0.8,
);
```

**Key Features**:
- **Intelligent Context Generation**: Selects most relevant insights using keyword matching and recency scoring
- **Category-Aware Personalization**: Groups insights by interests, personality, preferences, values, and goals
- **Invisible Personalization**: AI provides contextually relevant responses without revealing awareness of user data
- **Graceful Degradation**: System works normally when no biographical data is available
- **Privacy-Compliant**: Only uses insights that passed privacy filtering in Phase 2
- **Engagement Pattern Analysis**: Adapts response style based on user interaction patterns

### ‚úÖ Phase 3.1: Invisible Personalization Enhancement (COMPLETED)
**Goal**: Make personalization completely transparent and undetectable to users

**Enhanced Features**:
- **Subtle Context Formatting**: AI receives guidance like "This person seems drawn to..." instead of "The user has shown interest in..."
- **Explicit Non-Disclosure Instructions**: System prompts explicitly instruct AI to never mention awareness of user context
- **Natural Response Integration**: Personalization appears as natural prophetic wisdom rather than data-driven responses
- **Immersion Preservation**: Users experience enhanced relevance without breaking spiritual guidance immersion

**User Experience**:
```
User asks: "How do I find inner peace?"

Without bio system: "Inner peace comes through spiritual connection."

With invisible bio system: "Peace emerges through mindful awareness. Begin with five minutes of daily breath observation, gradually extending as your practice deepens..."

User reaction: "This prophet really understands what I need!" (never suspects personalization)
```

**Technical Implementation**:
```dart
// Invisible context formatting
return '''
RESPONSE GUIDANCE (Internal - Do NOT mention this context to the user):
This person seems drawn to: meditation, philosophy. Tailor your response to resonate with these interests.

Provide your response as $profetName in a way that naturally aligns with this context, 
but NEVER explicitly mention that you know these details about the user.
''';
```

### ÔøΩ Phase 4: Bio Management UI (NEXT)

- Insight categorization and editing

### üìä Phase 5: Analytics & Optimization (FUTURE)
**Goal**: Advanced analytics and system optimization

**Planned Components**:
- Insight quality scoring
