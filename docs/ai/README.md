# AI Documentation

This directory contains technical documentation created by AI assistants during development. **These documents are specifically designed to instruct and inform future AI agents working on this codebase, not for human developers.**

## Documents

- `onboarding-system-implementation.md` - Complete technical reference for the onboarding system implementation, including system architecture, screen flow, storage mechanics, localization fixes, feature removals, and prophet name localization across all screens.
- `admob-integration-architecture.md` - Technical documentation for AdMob integration architecture, implementation patterns, and advertising system integration within the app.

## Purpose

This documentation serves as AI agent instruction material for:
- Technical reference for future AI development sessions
- Implementation details for complex system changes and debugging
- Debugging guide for localization and persistence issues
- Architecture overview for AI agents working on system extensions
- Step-by-step troubleshooting procedures for common issues
- Code patterns and architectural decisions context

## Target Audience

**Primary**: AI assistants and coding agents
**Secondary**: Human developers seeking detailed technical implementation context

## Maintenance

AI agents should update these documents when making significant changes to the systems they describe. The documentation should maintain the technical depth and implementation specificity required for effective AI-to-AI knowledge transfer.
